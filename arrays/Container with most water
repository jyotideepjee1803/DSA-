11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        
        //two pointers at the end and beginning of array :
        int i=0, j=height.size()-1;
        
        int mxAr = 0;
        while(i < j){
            int h = min(height[i],height[j]);
            
            mxAr = max(mxAr, (j-i)*h);
            
            //if the height at one end is less than height of water level
            //shrink the current window : 
            while(height[i] <= h and i < j) i++;
            while(height[j] <= h and i < j) j--; 
        }
        
        return mxAr;
    }
